<p>We highly appreciate any contributions that help us improve the end product, with a high emphasis being put on any bug fixes you can manage to create and direct improvements which address the top issues reported by <a class="el" href="namespace_dry_chem.html" title="Allow for a shorter namespace name for less using statements. ">DryChem</a> users. Some general guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow our coding and style <a href="#Style-guidelines">Coding and Style</a> guidelines, and keep code changes as small as possible.</li>
<li>Include corresponding tests. The project strives for as close to 100% unit-test coverage as possible, so be sure your changes do the same.</li>
<li>Check for additional occurrences of the same problem in other parts of the codebase before submitting your PR.</li>
<li>Link the issue you are addressing in the pull request.</li>
<li>Write a good description for your pull request. More detail is better. Describe <em>why</em> the change is being made and <em>why</em> you have chosen a particular solution. Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.</li>
<li>Do not merge multiple changes into one PR unless they have the same root cause.</li>
<li>Do not merge directly into the main branch.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Submitting a pull request for an approved Issue is not a guarantee it will be approved. The change must meet our high bar for code quality, architecture, and performance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To learn how to build the code and run tests, follow the instructions in <a class="el" href="_b_u_i_l_d_8md.html">docs/BUILD.md</a>.</p>
<p>Please attempt to match the style of surrounding code as much as possible. In new components, prefer the patterns described in the <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines">C++ core guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>We have provided a <a href="../cmake/scripts/format-codebase.sh">script</a> that runs <code>clang-format</code> on every specified file in the repository. As new files are added, you are expected to add those files to this script in the appropriate location and format the code according to the formatting specifications seen <a href="../.clang-format">here</a>.</p>
<p>While <code>clang-format</code> is certainly a useful tool, there are some style options we prefer that don't actually have an appropriate option when running <code>clang-format</code>. In these edge cases we will decide whether the supplied formatting will go through or not. For examples of files where the formatting we use is different from what <code>clang-format</code> suggests, take a look at the <a href="../CMakeLists.txt"><code>CMakeLists.txt</code></a> file, specifically in the section using the <code>format_codebase</code> option.</p>
<p><em><b>Run clang-format</b></em></p>
<p>Use the following commands during the build phase to run <code>clang-format</code> (must be installed on the host system):</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">cd build</div><div class="line">cmake ../drychem/. -Dformat_codebase=ON</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Your change should include tests to verify new functionality wherever possible. Code should be structured so that it can be unit tested independently of the UI. Manual test cases should be used where automated testing is not feasible.</p>
<p>The core principle of the project, when it comes to Git workflows is that the <code>main</code> branch should always be in a healthy state which is ready for release. Every commit on main should be deployable on push. To ensure this, pull request <b>must not</b> be made directly on main. <b>Each change</b> should either be made in the <b>development branch</b> (named a variation of development, i.e. <code>dev</code>) or in a separate branch, named as a short summary of the change.</p>
<p>If your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request. You can use <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing">git rebase</a> to group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.</p>
<p>When completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. After confirming that the change works as intended, the branch <em>might</em> be deleted, in order to prevent branch polluting. Please let us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.</p>
<p>For this project, CI is provided by <a href="https://github.com/crdrisko/drychem/actions">GitHub-Actions</a>, with workflows found in <a href="https://github.com/crdrisko/drychem/blob/main/.github/workflows/cmake.yml">cmake.yml</a>. Workflows are run automatically on every commit made on the main branch, unless told to skip for that particular commit.</p>
<p>To skip CI runs on a particular commit, include either <code>[skip ci]</code> or <code>[ci skip]</code> in the commit message.</p>
<p>After submitting a pull request, members of the team will review your code. We will assign the request to an appropriate reviewer (if applicable). Any member of the community may participate in the review, but at least one member of the project team will ultimately approve the request.</p>
<p>Often, multiple iterations or discussions will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at <a href="https://github.com/crdrisko/drychem/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">past pull requests</a> to see what the experience might be like.</p>
<p>Before we can review and accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA ensures that the community is free to use your contributions. Signing the CLA is a manual process, and you need to do it for each pull request made. This is done by checking the boxes in the <a href="PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#Pull-Request-Readiness-Checklist">Pull Request Readiness Checklist of a Pull Request</a>.</p>
<p><em><b>Checking the aforementioned boxes means that you agree to provide your change and/or code FREE TO USE and SUBJECT TO CHANGES for the entire community!</b></em></p>
<p>You don't need to sign a CLA until you're ready to create a pull request. When your pull request is created, it is reviewed by a team member which, if the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) will be labeled as <code>cla-not-required</code>. Otherwise, it's classified as <code>cla-required</code>, if not already signed. </p>
