# C++ Units

This project contains a unit converter written in C++ designed to be extendable with a number of interfaces. Currently, the public API of the project is in the development stage, but I hope to add a command line interface (CLI), graphical user interface (GUI), and web application very soon. Each of these interfaces will serve to help my software development skills by focusing on a singular project I can continue to enhance as I learn more.
